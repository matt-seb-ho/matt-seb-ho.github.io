I am a second year CS PhD student at University of California, San Diego where I am advised by [Prof. Lianhui Qin](https://lianhui.ucsd.edu).
I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara where I worked with [Prof. William Wang](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) and the [UCSB NLP group](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu).

### Research Interests
My research interests broadly lie in LLM reasoning.
I study methods for improving and evaluating LLMs' reasoning capabilities towards the ultimate goal of developing systems to assist human experts to solve frontier problems in math, science, and engineering.
I am particularly interested in self-improving techniques and meta-learning methods that allow models to efficiently acquire new skills and learn useful abstractions on the fly.
